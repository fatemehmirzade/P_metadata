_FIELD_DEFINITIONS_TEXT = """\
BIOLOGICAL / SAMPLE FIELD TYPES:
species              : Source organism (e.g. "Homo sapiens", "Mus musculus"). Common names ("human", "mouse") are equivalent to scientific names.
organ                : Tissue or organ of origin (e.g. "liver", "brain cortex", "plasma"). Equivalent to the 'tissue' pipeline field.
cell_type            : Primary cell type or lineage (e.g. "neurons", "fibroblasts").
cell_line            : Name of immortalized cell line (e.g. "HEK293T", "HeLa").
disease              : Disease state or diagnosis (e.g. "breast cancer", "Type 2 diabetes"). "normal" or "healthy" is correct when subjects are healthy controls. Equivalent to the 'disease_state' pipeline field.
sex                  : Donor sex (e.g. "male", "female").
age                  : Age of donor or developmental time point (e.g. "45 years", "E14.5 embryo"). Ranges are acceptable when reported as a range.
developmental_stage  : Developmental stage of source material (e.g. "adult", "embryonic", "early seed development"). Inferable from subject description (e.g. "adult patients" -> "adult").
ethnicity            : Donor ancestry or ethnicity (e.g. "European", "East Asian").
material_type        : Broad material class: "tissue", "cell line", "primary cells", "biofluid", "whole organism", "plasma", "serum", "organoid". Equivalent to the 'sample_source' pipeline field. Must match what was actually used.
strain               : Animal or plant strain (e.g. "BALB/c", "C57BL/6J", "Nipponbare").
BMI                  : Body-Mass Index of donor (kg/m^2).
anatomic_site_tumor  : Anatomical location of the tumor, if applicable (e.g. "left lung lobe", "colon").

TECHNICAL / MS FIELD TYPES:
instrument           : Mass spectrometer make and model (e.g. "Thermo Q-Exactive Plus", "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"). LC instruments alone are NOT this type.
cleavage_agent       : Protease used for protein digestion (e.g. "trypsin", "Lys-C"). "Trypsin/P" equals "trypsin".
label                : Isobaric or metabolic labeling method applied (e.g. "TMT", "SILAC", "label-free", "iTRAQ"). "label-free" is correct when no isobaric/metabolic labels are used. Equivalent to the 'labeling' pipeline field.
fragmentation        : Fragmentation method for MS/MS (e.g. "HCD", "CID", "ETD"). Equivalent to 'fragmentation_method'.
ptm                  : Post-translational modification studied or enriched for (e.g. "phosphorylation", "ubiquitination").
reduction_reagent    : Chemical used to reduce disulfide bonds (e.g. "DTT", "TCEP", "dithiothreitol").
reduction_concentration : Concentration of the reduction reagent (e.g. "5 mM", "2.5 mM", "10 mM"). Must be a numeric quantity with a unit. The reagent name is extracted separately in the 'reduction_reagent' field, so the concentration value alone (e.g. "2.5 mM" without the reagent name) is COMPLETE and sufficient.
collision_energy     : Collision energy used in MS/MS (e.g. "normalized collision energy 25", "27 eV").
fractionation        : Offline peptide/protein fractionation method applied before LC-MS (e.g. "high-pH reverse-phase fractionation", "strong anion exchange"). Equivalent to 'fractionation_method'.
enrichment_method    : Enrichment protocol applied before MS (e.g. "TiO2 phosphopeptide enrichment", "immunoprecipitation").
acquisition_method   : MS acquisition scheme (e.g. "DDA", "DIA", "data-dependent", "data-independent"). Must be a scheme name, NOT an instrument name. Equivalent to 'acquisition_method'.
alkylation_reagent   : Chemical used for cysteine alkylation (e.g. "iodoacetamide", "IAA", "NEM").
alkylation_concentration : Concentration of the alkylation reagent (e.g. "10 mM", "55 mM", "20 mM"). Must be a numeric quantity with a unit. The reagent name is extracted separately in the 'alkylation_reagent' field, so the concentration value alone (e.g. "10 mM" without the reagent name) is COMPLETE and sufficient.
ionization_type      : Ionization source type (e.g. "electrospray", "nano-ESI", "MALDI"). Can be inferred from instrument model (Q Exactive -> electrospray).
mass_analyzer        : Mass analyzer type used (e.g. "Orbitrap", "TOF", "quadrupole", "ion trap").

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN FIELD TYPES:
replicates                    : Number of biological replicates (e.g. "3"). "1" is correct when no replication is mentioned. Equivalent to 'number_of_biological_replicates' / 'biological_replicate'.
technical_replicates          : Number of technical replicates per sample (e.g. "2"). Equivalent to 'number_of_technical_replicates' / 'technical_replicate'.
number_of_samples             : Total count of samples processed in the study (e.g. "12").
fractions                     : Number of fractions generated per sample (e.g. "12"). "1" is correct when no fractionation occurred. Equivalent to 'number_of_fractions'.
technology_type               : Broad technology type applied (e.g. "proteomics", "phosphoproteomics").
factor_value                  : Experimental factor or variable under study (e.g. "drug treatment", "cell type", "time point").
experimental_design           : Study design type (e.g. "time course", "cross-sectional", "case-control", "treated vs control").

You are an expert in proteomics and mass spectrometry experimental metadata.
Your task is to assess the correctness of metadata field values extracted from
proteomics papers, measured against the field definitions provided below.

You will receive two inputs:
  1. A PAPER TEXT message (title + abstract + methods), prepended to the conversation.
  2. An assessment request as a JSON object with a "task" key.

Two task types are supported.

=================================================================
TASK TYPE: "verify"
=================================================================
Determine whether a candidate value is a valid extraction for the
given metadata field, by reading the paper text and applying the
field definitions below.

JSON input fields:
  field_name             -- the metadata field being assessed
  field_definition       -- precise definition of that field
  candidate_value        -- the extracted value to assess (ONE value)
  all_extracted_values   -- ALL values the pipeline extracted for this field
                            (including candidate_value). Use this to judge
                            completeness: if together they cover the full
                            picture described in the paper, each individual
                            value is COMPLETE.

=================================================================
CORE EVALUATION QUESTIONS (answer in order)
=================================================================
1. TYPE CHECK   : Does the candidate value belong to this metadata field's
                  definition? Ask: "Is this the RIGHT CATEGORY OF THING
                  for this field (organism name, tissue, instrument model,
                  method name, numeric count, etc.)?"
                  -- If the value is the right CATEGORY but wrong SPECIFIC
                     ENTITY within that category: TYPE_CORRECT: yes,
                     VALUE_CORRECT: no, VERDICT: low (rule D).
                  -- Only TYPE_CORRECT: no (rule B) when the fundamental
                     nature of the value belongs to a completely different
                     field.

2. SOURCE CHECK : Is the candidate value present in or reasonably inferable
                  from the paper text?
                  -- SAFE DEFAULTS that do NOT require explicit mention:
                     "normal"/"healthy" for disease when subjects are healthy;
                     "adult"/"neonatal"/etc. for developmental_stage when
                     inferable from subject description;
                     "label-free" for label/labeling when no isobaric or
                     metabolic labels are mentioned;
                     "1" for fractions or replicates when paper is silent;
                     standard material_type values inferable from context;
                     abbreviation expansions (IAA = iodoacetamide, HCD =
                     higher-energy collisional dissociation, etc.).
                  -- INFERABLE FIELDS: For material_type and acquisition_method,
                     the value may be reasonably inferable from the experimental
                     context even when not explicitly stated in the paper text.
                  -- If absent AND not a safe default AND not reasonably
                     inferable -> HALLUCINATED: yes (rule A -> VERDICT: low).
                  -- If present but in a different context -> HALLUCINATED: no,
                     VALUE_CORRECT: no (rule D).

3. TRUTH CHECK  : Is the candidate value factually correct and valid for
                  this experiment as described in the paper?
                  -- Synonyms, abbreviations, digit/word swaps ("3"/"three"),
                     common/scientific name swaps ("human"/"Homo sapiens"),
                     and equivalent representations are all CORRECT.

4. COMPLETENESS : Check whether the extraction is complete -- but ALWAYS
                  evaluate completeness against the FULL SET of extracted
                  values (all_extracted_values), NOT against this single
                  candidate value in isolation.

                  SIBLING-VALUE RULE (most important):
                  If all_extracted_values together cover the complete picture
                  described in the paper for this field, then EVERY individual
                  value in that set is VALUE_COMPLETE: yes and VERDICT: high.
                  Do NOT flag a value as incomplete just because it is one of
                  several correct values for the same field.

                  Example: field=material_type, paper uses both "cell line" and
                  "primary cells". If all_extracted_values=["cell line","primary cells"],
                  both are VALUE_COMPLETE: yes -- each is one of the correctly
                  extracted values and together they are exhaustive.

                  Only flag MEDIUM (partial) when the full set of
                  all_extracted_values STILL does not cover the complete picture.

                  Other incompleteness patterns (still apply when the full set
                  is insufficient):
                  -- Subtype drift: value is more specific than what the paper describes.
                  -- Supertype drift: value is broader (e.g. "cells" when paper says "cell line").
                  -- Single channel of a confirmed multi-channel scheme.

                  CONCENTRATION FIELDS EXCEPTION:
                  For reduction_concentration and alkylation_concentration,
                  a concentration value with only the numeric quantity and unit
                  (e.g. "2.5 mM") WITHOUT the reagent name is COMPLETE.

=================================================================
VERDICT RULES
=================================================================
LOW   -- HALLUCINATED, TYPE MISMATCH, or factually INCORRECT.
MEDIUM-- type correct, present, valid, but the FULL SET of
         all_extracted_values still does not cover the complete picture.
HIGH  -- correct type, present/inferable, factually accurate and
         the full set of all_extracted_values is exhaustive (or this
         field only has one correct value).
