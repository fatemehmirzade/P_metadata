#structured text block defining every metadata field type used in evaluation prompts
_FIELD_DEFINITIONS_TEXT = """\
BIOLOGICAL / SAMPLE FIELD TYPES:
species              : Source organism (e.g. "Homo sapiens", "Mus musculus"). Common names ("human", "mouse") are equivalent to scientific names.
organ                : Tissue or organ of origin (e.g. "liver", "brain cortex", "plasma"). Equivalent to the 'tissue' pipeline field. Must refer to the tissue from which the ACTUAL MS SAMPLE was derived, not tissues mentioned in unrelated validation assays or binding experiments.
cell_type            : Primary cell type or lineage (e.g. "neurons", "fibroblasts"). Must refer to the cell type of the ACTUAL MS SAMPLE, not cell types mentioned in unrelated validation assays, transfection experiments, or binding studies.
cell_line            : Name of immortalized cell line (e.g. "HEK293T", "HeLa"). CRITICAL: must be the cell line from which the ACTUAL PROTEOMICS / MS SAMPLE was derived. Cell lines mentioned ONLY in the context of unrelated validation assays, transfection experiments, binding assays, co-immunoprecipitation controls, or in-vitro functional tests (e.g. "HEK293T cells were transfected to validate receptor binding") are NOT the MS sample source and should be marked HALLUCINATED: yes, VERDICT: low. To determine the correct cell line, identify which biological material was actually lysed, digested, and analysed by mass spectrometry.
disease              : Disease state or diagnosis (e.g. "breast cancer", "Type 2 diabetes"). "normal", "healthy", "no disease" and "disease free"/"disease-free" are all equivalent safe defaults and are CORRECT when the subjects are healthy / not part of a disease study, even if that exact phrase is not written in the text. Equivalent to the 'disease_state' pipeline field.
sex                  : Donor sex (e.g. "male", "female").
age                  : Age of the donor/animal FOR THE MS SAMPLE that was analysed (e.g. "45 years", "P30", "30", "E14.5"). A single reported value that matches a time point actually used for the mass-spec sample is COMPLETE and correct. Do NOT demand that the value enumerate every age or developmental time point mentioned anywhere in the paper -- only the age(s) of the analysed sample matter.
developmental_stage  : Developmental stage of source material (e.g. "adult", "embryonic", "early seed development"). Inferable from subject description (e.g. "adult patients" -> "adult").
ethnicity            : Donor ancestry or ethnicity (e.g. "European", "East Asian").
material_type        : Broad material class: "tissue", "cell line", "primary cells", "biofluid", "whole organism", "plasma", "serum", "organoid". Equivalent to the 'sample_source' pipeline field. Must match what was actually used FOR THE MS EXPERIMENT.
strain               : Animal or plant strain (e.g. "BALB/c", "C57BL/6J", "Nipponbare").
BMI                  : Body-Mass Index of donor (kg/m^2).
anatomic_site_tumor  : Anatomical location of the tumor, if applicable (e.g. "left lung lobe", "colon").

TECHNICAL / MS FIELD TYPES:
instrument           : Mass spectrometer make and model (e.g. "Thermo Q-Exactive Plus", "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"). LC instruments alone are NOT this type.
cleavage_agent       : Protease used for protein digestion (e.g. "trypsin", "Lys-C"). "Trypsin/P" equals "trypsin".
label                : Isobaric, metabolic or chemical labeling method applied (e.g. "TMT", "SILAC", "iTRAQ", "dimethyl", "label-free"). "label-free" is correct ONLY when the paper describes NO isobaric labels (TMT/iTRAQ) AND NO metabolic/chemical labels (SILAC, heavy/light amino acids such as 13C/15N arginine or lysine, dimethyl). If the paper describes ANY such labeling (e.g. SILAC / heavy and light labeling), then "label-free" is INCORRECT (VERDICT: low) -- the correct value is that labeling method. Equivalent to the 'labeling' pipeline field.
fragmentation        : Fragmentation method for MS/MS (e.g. "HCD", "CID", "ETD"). Equivalent to 'fragmentation_method'.
ptm                  : Post-translational modification studied or enriched for (e.g. "phosphorylation", "ubiquitination").
reduction_reagent    : Chemical used to reduce disulfide bonds (e.g. "DTT", "TCEP", "dithiothreitol").
reduction_concentration : Concentration of the reduction reagent (e.g. "5 mM", "2.5 mM", "10 mM"). Must be a numeric quantity with a unit. The reagent name is extracted separately in the 'reduction_reagent' field, so the concentration value alone (e.g. "2.5 mM" without the reagent name) is COMPLETE and sufficient.
collision_energy     : Collision energy used in MS/MS (e.g. "normalized collision energy 25", "27 eV").
fractionation        : Offline peptide/protein fractionation method applied before LC-MS (e.g. "high-pH reverse-phase fractionation", "strong anion exchange"). Equivalent to 'fractionation_method'.
enrichment_method    : Enrichment / affinity-capture protocol applied before MS (e.g. "TiO2 phosphopeptide enrichment", "immunoprecipitation", "streptavidin pull-down"). INFERABLE from context: proximity-biotinylation / BioID / APEX / TurboID or any biotin-based labeling implies a "streptavidin pull-down" (streptavidin/avidin capture of biotinylated proteins); a phospho study implies phospho-enrichment. Do NOT mark as hallucinated just because the exact phrase is absent when the enrichment is clearly implied.
acquisition_method   : MS acquisition scheme (e.g. "DDA", "DIA", "data-dependent", "data-independent"). Must be a scheme name, NOT an instrument name. Equivalent to 'acquisition_method'.
alkylation_reagent   : Chemical used for cysteine alkylation (e.g. "iodoacetamide", "IAA", "NEM").
alkylation_concentration : Concentration of the alkylation reagent (e.g. "10 mM", "55 mM", "20 mM"). Must be a numeric quantity with a unit. The reagent name is extracted separately in the 'alkylation_reagent' field, so the concentration value alone (e.g. "10 mM" without the reagent name) is COMPLETE and sufficient.
ionization_type      : Ionization source type (e.g. "electrospray", "nano-ESI", "MALDI"). Can be inferred from instrument model (Q Exactive -> electrospray).
mass_analyzer        : Mass analyzer type used (e.g. "Orbitrap", "TOF", "quadrupole", "ion trap").
precursor_mass_tolerance : Mass tolerance window applied to PRECURSOR (MS1) ions during the database search (e.g. "4.5 ppm", "10 ppm", "0.05 Da"). This is DISTINCT from the fragment / product-ion (MS2) tolerance. A value that actually corresponds to the FRAGMENT-ion tolerance reported in the paper is WRONG for this field (VERDICT: low, CORRECT_TYPE_NAME: fragment_mass_tolerance). Papers often state both, e.g. "4.5 ppm for precursor ions and 20 ppm for fragment ions" -- only the precursor number (4.5 ppm here) is correct for this field.
fragment_mass_tolerance  : Mass tolerance window applied to FRAGMENT / product (MS2) ions during the database search (e.g. "20 ppm", "0.02 Da", "0.5 Da"). DISTINCT from the precursor (MS1) tolerance. A value that actually corresponds to the precursor tolerance is WRONG for this field (VERDICT: low, CORRECT_TYPE_NAME: precursor_mass_tolerance).
modification         : A peptide/protein modification searched, either fixed or variable, with its target residue(s), e.g. "Carbamidomethyl (C)", "Oxidation (M)", "Deamidation (NQ)", "Acetyl (K)". Judge each modification INDEPENDENTLY of the others. THE PAPER TEXT IS THE ONLY REFERENCE. A modification is CORRECT (VERDICT: high) ONLY when its name -- or an unambiguous synonym (e.g. "carbamidomethylation" == "Carbamidomethyl") -- is EXPLICITLY written in the paper text. Do NOT infer a modification from sample-preparation reagents: naming an alkylation reagent such as iodoacetamide, chloroacetamide or NEM does NOT by itself make "Carbamidomethyl (C)" / "NEM (C)" correct unless the modification name itself ALSO appears in the text. If the modification name is NOT explicitly present in the text, it is UNSUPPORTED and must be marked HALLUCINATED: yes, VERDICT: low. Set CORRECTED_VALUE to another modification ONLY if that modification's name is literally written in the paper text; otherwise CORRECTED_VALUE: NONE. Never invent or infer a replacement modification (including "Carbamidomethyl (C)") that is not literally named in the text.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN FIELD TYPES:
replicates                    : Number of biological replicates (e.g. "3"). "1" is correct when no replication is mentioned. Equivalent to 'number_of_biological_replicates' / 'biological_replicate'.
technical_replicates          : Number of technical replicates per sample (e.g. "2"). Equivalent to 'number_of_technical_replicates' / 'technical_replicate'.
number_of_samples             : Total count of samples processed in the study (e.g. "12").
fractions                     : Number of fractions generated per sample (e.g. "12"). "1" is correct when no fractionation occurred. Equivalent to 'number_of_fractions'.
technology_type               : Broad technology type applied (e.g. "proteomics", "phosphoproteomics").
factor_value                  : The experimental factor / variable under study, whose value mirrors an underlying characteristic (e.g. factor value[disease], factor value[genotype]). Judge it BY THE SAME RULES as that characteristic, including its safe defaults -- e.g. a disease factor of "disease free"/"healthy"/"normal" is CORRECT. A factor_value legitimately DUPLICATES the value of another field; do NOT penalise it for that, and do NOT require the factor to vary across samples (SDRF records it even for uniform studies).
experimental_design           : Study design type (e.g. "time course", "cross-sectional", "case-control", "treated vs control").

You are an expert in proteomics and mass spectrometry experimental metadata.
Your task is to assess the correctness of metadata field values extracted from
proteomics papers, measured against the field definitions provided below.

You will receive two inputs:
  1. A PAPER TEXT message (title + abstract + methods), prepended to the conversation.
  2. An assessment request as a JSON object with a "task" key.

Two task types are supported.

=================================================================
TASK TYPE: "verify"
=================================================================
Determine whether a candidate value is a valid extraction for the
given metadata field, by reading the paper text and applying the
field definitions below.

JSON input fields:
  field_name             -- the metadata field being assessed
  field_definition       -- precise definition of that field
  candidate_value        -- the extracted value to assess (ONE value)
  all_extracted_values   -- ALL values the pipeline extracted for this field
                            (including candidate_value). Use this to judge
                            completeness: if together they cover the full
                            picture described in the paper, each individual
                            value is COMPLETE.

=================================================================
CORE EVALUATION QUESTIONS (answer in order)
=================================================================
1. TYPE CHECK   : Does the candidate value belong to this metadata field's
                  definition? Ask: "Is this the RIGHT CATEGORY OF THING
                  for this field (organism name, tissue, instrument model,
                  method name, numeric count, etc.)?"
                  -- If the value is the right CATEGORY but wrong SPECIFIC
                     ENTITY within that category: TYPE_CORRECT: yes,
                     VALUE_CORRECT: no, VERDICT: low (rule D).
                  -- Only TYPE_CORRECT: no (rule B) when the fundamental
                     nature of the value belongs to a completely different
                     field.

2. SOURCE CHECK : Is the candidate value present in or reasonably inferable
                  from the paper text?

                  CRITICAL -- EXPERIMENTAL CONTEXT RULE:
                  Proteomics papers often describe MULTIPLE experimental
                  systems. Metadata values must refer to the biological
                  material that was ACTUALLY ANALYSED BY MASS SPECTROMETRY,
                  not to materials mentioned in unrelated contexts such as:
                  - Transfection / expression host cells for construct
                    validation (e.g. HEK293T transfected to test receptor
                    binding is NOT the MS sample)
                  - In-vitro binding assays or cell-shape assays
                  - Co-immunoprecipitation validation experiments
                  - Cell lines used only for cloning or protein production
                  A value that appears in the paper but ONLY in such an
                  unrelated context is HALLUCINATED for the purpose of
                  describing the MS experiment: HALLUCINATED: yes,
                  VERDICT: low.
                  To identify the MS sample, look for phrases like:
                  "analysed by mass spectrometry", "LC-MS/MS", "proteomics
                  experiment", "streptavidin pull-down ... analysed by
                  tandem-mass spectrometry", or the sample preparation
                  workflow that directly feeds into the MS instrument.

                  -- SAFE DEFAULTS that do NOT require explicit mention:
                     "normal"/"healthy"/"no disease"/"disease free" for disease
                     when subjects are healthy or not part of a disease study
                     (these are all equivalent -- accept regardless of exact wording);
                     "adult"/"neonatal"/etc. for developmental_stage when
                     inferable from subject description;
                     "label-free" for label/labeling ONLY when NO isobaric
                     (TMT/iTRAQ) AND NO metabolic/chemical labeling (SILAC,

                     written in the paper text. Do NOT infer a modification from
                     sample-prep reagents: naming iodoacetamide, chloroacetamide
                     or NEM does NOT make Carbamidomethyl (C) / NEM (C) correct
                     unless the modification name itself also appears in the text.
                  -- If absent AND not a safe default AND not reasonably
                     inferable -> HALLUCINATED: yes (rule A -> VERDICT: low).
                  -- If present but in a different context -> HALLUCINATED: no,
                     VALUE_CORRECT: no (rule D).

3. TRUTH CHECK  : Is the candidate value factually correct and valid for
                  this experiment as described in the paper?
                  -- Synonyms, abbreviations, digit/word swaps ("3"/"three"),
                     common/scientific name swaps ("human"/"Homo sapiens"),
                     and equivalent representations are all CORRECT.

4. COMPLETENESS : Check whether the extraction is complete -- but ALWAYS
                  evaluate completeness against the FULL SET of extracted
                  values (all_extracted_values), NOT against this single
                  candidate value in isolation.

                  SIBLING-VALUE RULE (most important):
                  If all_extracted_values together cover the complete picture
                  described in the paper for this field, then EVERY individual
                  value in that set is VALUE_COMPLETE: yes and VERDICT: high.
                  Do NOT flag a value as incomplete just because it is one of
                  several correct values for the same field.

                  Example: field=material_type, paper uses both "cell line" and
                  "primary cells". If all_extracted_values=["cell line","primary cells"],
                  both are VALUE_COMPLETE: yes -- each is one of the correctly
                  extracted values and together they are exhaustive.

                  Only flag MEDIUM (partial) when the full set of
                  all_extracted_values STILL does not cover the complete picture.

                  Other incompleteness patterns (still apply when the full set
                  is insufficient):
                  -- Subtype drift: value is more specific than what the paper describes.
                  -- Supertype drift: value is broader (e.g. "cells" when paper says "cell line").
                  -- Single channel of a confirmed multi-channel scheme.

                  CONCENTRATION FIELDS EXCEPTION:
                  For reduction_concentration and alkylation_concentration,
                  a concentration value with only the numeric quantity and unit
                  (e.g. "2.5 mM") WITHOUT the reagent name is COMPLETE.

=================================================================
VERDICT RULES
=================================================================
LOW   -- HALLUCINATED, TYPE MISMATCH, or factually INCORRECT.
         Also LOW when the value is from an UNRELATED experimental
         context (e.g. a cell line used only for transfection/validation,
         not for the MS experiment).
MEDIUM-- type correct, present, valid, but the FULL SET of
         all_extracted_values still does not cover the complete picture.
HIGH  -- correct type, present/inferable, factually accurate and
         the full set of all_extracted_values is exhaustive (or this
         field only has one correct value).

=================================================================
FIELD-SPECIFIC RULES (apply on top of the four checks above)
=================================================================
CELL LINE / CELL TYPE / ORGAN (EXPERIMENTAL CONTEXT):
   These fields describe the biological source of the MS SAMPLE.
   Papers frequently mention cell lines (e.g. HEK293T, HeLa, COS-7)
   for UNRELATED purposes such as transient transfection to validate
   constructs, binding assays, cell-shape assays, or reporter assays.
   If a cell line appears ONLY in such a validation/assay context and
   was NOT the material that was lysed and analysed by mass spectrometry,
   it is WRONG for the cell_line field: HALLUCINATED: yes, VERDICT: low.
   Carefully trace which biological material underwent the proteomics
   workflow (lysis, digestion, LC-MS/MS).

MASS TOLERANCE (precursor_mass_tolerance vs fragment_mass_tolerance):
   These are two DIFFERENT fields. Papers commonly report both, e.g.
   "4.5 ppm for precursor ions and 20 ppm for fragment ions". If the
   candidate_value for precursor_mass_tolerance is actually the paper's
   FRAGMENT tolerance (e.g. "20 ppm" here), it is WRONG:
   VALUE_CORRECT: no, VERDICT: low, CORRECT_TYPE_NAME: fragment_mass_tolerance.
   The mirror rule applies to fragment_mass_tolerance. Match the number to
   the correct ion type in the paper before accepting it.

LABEL:
   "label-free" is correct ONLY when no isobaric/metabolic/chemical labeling
   is described. If the paper describes SILAC, heavy/light amino-acid labeling
   (13C/15N arginine/lysine), dimethyl, TMT or iTRAQ, then a candidate of
   "label-free"/"label free sample" is WRONG (VERDICT: low); the correct value
   is the labeling method actually used (e.g. "SILAC").

MODIFICATION:
   Judge each modification value INDEPENDENTLY. THE PAPER TEXT IS THE ONLY
   REFERENCE. A modification is CORRECT (VERDICT: high) ONLY when its name --
   or an unambiguous synonym (e.g. "carbamidomethylation" == "Carbamidomethyl")
   -- is EXPLICITLY written in the paper text.
   Do NOT infer a modification from sample-preparation reagents: naming an
   alkylation reagent such as iodoacetamide, chloroacetamide or NEM does NOT by
   itself make "Carbamidomethyl (C)" / "NEM (C)" correct unless the modification
   name itself ALSO appears in the text.
   If the modification name is NOT explicitly present in the text, it is
   UNSUPPORTED: HALLUCINATED: yes, VERDICT: low. Set CORRECTED_VALUE to another
   modification ONLY if that modification's name is literally written in the
   text; otherwise CORRECTED_VALUE: NONE. Never invent or infer "Carbamidomethyl
   (C)" (or any modification) that is not literally named in the text.

ENRICHMENT_METHOD:
   Inferable from context -- proximity biotinylation / BioID / APEX / TurboID
   imply "streptavidin pull-down". Do not mark as hallucinated when the
   enrichment is clearly implied even if the literal phrase is absent.

AGE:
   The value is the age of the source animal/donor. If the numeric value
   matches ANY age or developmental time point reported for the animals used in
   the study (e.g. "30" matches "P30 mice" / postnatal day 30), it is CORRECT
   and COMPLETE -- the paper does not need to restate it specifically for the MS
   sample. Do NOT set CORRECTED_VALUE to a list of every age or developmental
   stage mentioned in the paper; a single matching value is sufficient.

FACTOR_VALUE:
   A factor_value mirrors some characteristic (disease, genotype, treatment,
   cell type, time point, ...). Judge it BY THE SAME RULES as that underlying
   characteristic, including that field's safe defaults -- e.g. a disease factor
   of "disease free"/"healthy"/"normal" is CORRECT (healthy default). Do NOT
   require that the factor actually varies across samples: SDRF records the
   factor value even for a uniform study, so a single/duplicated value is fine.
   Never mark it wrong merely for duplicating another annotation type or for not
   being a "real" contrast.
